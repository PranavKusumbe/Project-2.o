SELECT id, name, role, std FROM users;

-- Check subjects
SELECT * FROM subjects WHERE standard = 5;

-- Check chapters
SELECT * FROM chapters LIMIT 10;

-- Check videos
SELECT id, title, chapter_id FROM videos LIMIT 10;

-- Check tests
SELECT id, title, chapter_id FROM tests LIMIT 10;

-- Check if student has taken tests
SELECT * FROM results WHERE user_id = 1;

-- Check chat messages
SELECT * FROM chat_messages ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check community posts
SELECT * FROM community_posts ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```
